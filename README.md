# Peter's Blog

# About 

This project is essentially a blog website for a client

The client wanted a blog website that can showcase his blog posts and have a form that allows users to subscribe to his blog.
                                            
In order to meet the needs of my client, I decided to use React.Js to build the website and then deploy it to Heroku 
                        
# Documentation

React.Js is used to create the overall website, the navigation bar, and subscription form</p>
                        
Formspree.io is used for the backend of the form itself 

Express.js is used to help deploy the website onto Heroku
