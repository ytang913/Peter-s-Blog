    description:
      'As children, we were told to pursue a higher education, with this being the only logical path after graduating high school.  The issue is that college is not for everyone as there are many other paths after high school, ranging from trade schools to entrepreneurship. Trade schools offer students the ability to learn trade craft which can be far more useful than doing a degree that has no interest to the student. Entrepreneurship is another great alternative to college because it gives people the ability to generate their own income and be their own boss, which is a great alternative for people who only want to work for themselves. Essentially, without alternatives to college, many students will feel that college is the only path and as a result, not be as happy as they can be.   ',
