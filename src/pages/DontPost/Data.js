  description:
    'In society, trying new things is very difficult due to the fact that when you first start something, your skill level is not very good. This will deter many beginners from trying new things because of their expectations in being good at something right away. As a result, a fear of trying new things is created and that specific fear will stop people from trying new things, contradicting what life is all about: experiences. That is why the phrase: \'Don\'\ t be afraid to be seen trying\' resonates with me because every time I first try to pick up a new hobby I tend to suck. But as I keep going, I eventually get better and better. The issue with me has always been being afraid to suck when first trying things because of the perception of others. The perception of judgement deters me from actually truly enjoying life. Hence why not being afraid to be seen trying is so essential because at the end of the day the perception of others is worthless and the only approval I ever need is my own.',
